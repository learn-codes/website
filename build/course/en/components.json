Ongoing check-ins also help to keep the patient on track.</p><p>Sustained virological response (SVR12), the marker for HCV cure after completion of therapy is defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks following the end of treatment. Recommended follow-up for patients who achieve SVR will depend on whether they have cirrhosis and/or are at risk of reinfection.</p><p>Finally, clinicians should ensure that patients understand their risk of re-infection, and help to educate patients on how to lower their risk. If someone does get re-infected, they should be offered re-treatment without stigma and discrimination.</p><p>It is by treating, and curing, people who inject drugs that we can collectively work towards the goal of eliminating HCV.</p>",
